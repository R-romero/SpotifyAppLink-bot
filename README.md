# SpotifyAppLink-bot
Telegram Bot which takes messages containing a Spotify URL and answers the chat with a cool Spotify URI

## About
Implements all processing logic through [@LuisTessaro/webtoapp-spotify-api](https://github.com/LuisTessaro/webtoapp-spotify-api "@LuisTessaro/webtoapp-spotify-api").

The bot itself mostly coordinates message reception/answer using [Telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf).

## Usage
You can find this bot at [t.me/SpotifyAppLink](https://t.me/cha_dos_spotify_bot).

You can either use it by itself and share it's answer or add it to your group. If you want it to delete the URL message in a group like it does on it's standalone version, just give it mod status.
